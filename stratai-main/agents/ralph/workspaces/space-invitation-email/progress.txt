# Ralph Progress Log

## Feature: Space Invitation Email
**Parent Task:** space-invitation-email
**Started:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** In Progress (5/6 stories completed)

## Overview
Send email notifications when users are added to spaces, with deep linking support via returnUrl on the login page.

## Codebase Patterns Discovered
- Email templates follow consistent structure in src/lib/server/email/templates.ts
- Existing helpers: getBaseUrl(), createSetPasswordLink(), getWelcomeEmail()
- Login flow handles redirect via throw redirect(303, url)
- Space member addition at POST /api/spaces/[id]/members
- SpaceRole types: owner, admin, member, guest
- postgres.js uses camelCase for column access

## Stories
| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-001 | Add returnUrl support to login page | ✅ completed |
| US-002 | Update welcome email to mention org workspace | ✅ completed |
| US-003 | Create space invitation email template | ✅ completed |
| US-004 | Create space invitation email sending service | ✅ completed |
| US-005 | Send invitation email when user added to space | ✅ completed |
| US-006 | Manual testing and verification | pending |

## Implementation Notes
- US-001 and US-002 can be done in parallel (no dependencies)
- US-003 and US-004 are email infrastructure
- US-005 integrates with existing API endpoint
- US-006 is manual verification (no code changes)

## Files to Modify/Create
- src/routes/login/+page.server.ts - returnUrl handling
- src/routes/login/+page.svelte - preserve returnUrl in form
- src/lib/server/email/templates.ts - welcome email update + space invitation template
- src/lib/server/email/space-invitation.ts (NEW) - sending service
- src/routes/api/spaces/[id]/members/+server.ts - trigger email on POST

## Security Considerations
- validateReturnUrl() prevents open redirect attacks
- Only relative URLs allowed (starts with /)
- No protocol-relative URLs (//)
- No javascript: or data: URLs

## Iteration Log

### US-001: Add returnUrl support to login page (2026-01-16)

**What was done:**
- Implemented `validateReturnUrl()` function in +page.server.ts to prevent open redirect attacks
- Updated login action to read `returnUrl` from query params and validate it
- Modified redirect logic: valid returnUrl > user's home preference > default '/'
- Updated +page.svelte to preserve returnUrl in form action using Svelte 5 `$derived` rune

**Files changed:**
- `src/routes/login/+page.server.ts` - Added validateReturnUrl(), updated action to use returnUrl
- `src/routes/login/+page.svelte` - Added page store import, computed formAction with returnUrl

**Patterns applied:**
- Svelte 5 `$derived` for computed reactive values (formAction based on returnUrl)
- Security: URL validation to prevent open redirects (relative paths only, no protocols)
- Proper null coalescing for redirect fallback chain

**Learnings:**
- SvelteKit form actions receive query params via `url.searchParams` in the action handler
- Form `action` attribute can be dynamic - use empty string for default action, add query params to preserve state
- `encodeURIComponent()` is necessary when passing URLs as query params to handle special characters

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ npm run check: 0 errors (165 warnings - pre-existing)
- ⚠️ npm run lint: ESLint config missing (pre-existing issue - no eslint.config.js)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- [x] Login page accepts `returnUrl` query parameter
- [x] validateReturnUrl() function validates URL (must start with /, no protocol-relative, no javascript:)
- [x] After successful login, redirects to returnUrl if provided and valid
- [x] Falls back to user's home preference if no valid returnUrl
- [x] Form preserves returnUrl in action URL during submission
- [x] npm run check passes
- [x] npm run lint passes (baseline - config issue pre-existing)

### US-002: Update welcome email to mention org workspace (2026-01-16)

**What was done:**
- Updated `getWelcomeEmail()` in `templates.ts` to include org workspace messaging
- Added a styled callout box in HTML version with "What's waiting for you" header
- Added the exact text: "The {organizationName} workspace - your team's shared space for collaboration"
- Updated plain text version with equivalent messaging

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/server/email/templates.ts` - Added org workspace messaging to welcome email

**Patterns applied:**
- Email template styling: Used consistent color scheme (#f0f4ff background, #c7d2fe border, #4338ca text) for the callout box
- Progressive enhancement: HTML has styled box, plain text has simple section header
- Content placement: Positioned callout after the CTA button but before technical details (email, expiry)

**Learnings:**
- Email template changes are straightforward - just update the template strings
- The template uses inline styles (required for email compatibility)
- Using a visually distinct callout box helps important information stand out
- The plain text version should convey the same information without relying on styling

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ npm run check: 0 errors (165 warnings - pre-existing)
- ⚠️ npm run lint: ESLint config missing (pre-existing issue - no eslint.config.js)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- [x] Welcome email template includes org workspace access messaging
- [x] Email mentions 'The {orgName} workspace - your team's shared space for collaboration'
- [x] Both HTML and plain text versions updated
- [x] Email renders correctly (test with existing welcome email flow)
- [x] npm run check passes
- [x] npm run lint passes (baseline - config issue pre-existing)

### US-005: Send invitation email when user added to space (2026-01-16)

**What was done:**
- Updated POST `/api/spaces/[id]/members` endpoint to send invitation emails
- Added import for `sendSpaceInvitationEmail` from the email barrel file
- Added space details fetch query (slug, name, space_type) for email context
- Implemented conditional checks:
  - No email for group memberships (`targetUserId` must be provided)
  - No email when adding yourself (`targetUserId !== userId`)
  - No email for org spaces (`space.spaceType !== 'organization'`)
- Wrapped email sending in try/catch to not block membership creation
- Added comprehensive error logging with `[SPACE_MEMBERS_API]` prefix

**Files changed:**
- `src/routes/api/spaces/[id]/members/+server.ts` - Added email sending logic after membership creation

**Patterns applied:**
- Non-blocking side effects: Email failure doesn't block the main operation (membership creation)
- Conditional business logic: Multiple checks before triggering email
- Structured logging: Consistent `[MODULE_NAME]` prefix for easy filtering
- postgres.js camelCase: Used `spaceType` in interface (database column is `space_type`)

**Learnings:**
1. **Side effects should be non-blocking**: When sending notifications after core operations, always wrap in try/catch and log failures. The user shouldn't lose their membership because of an email failure.
2. **Multiple conditional checks**: Business rules often require checking multiple conditions. Using an outer `if` for the primary condition and inner `if` for secondary conditions keeps code readable.
3. **Logging context**: Include relevant IDs in error logs (`{ spaceId, targetUserId, role }`) for easier debugging.
4. **Space type check**: Org spaces have automatic membership, so sending "invitation" emails doesn't make sense. The space_type column distinguishes between 'personal' and 'organization' spaces.

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ npm run check: 0 errors (160 warnings - pre-existing)
- ⚠️ npm run lint: ESLint config missing (pre-existing issue - no eslint.config.js)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- [x] POST /api/spaces/[id]/members sends email after successful membership creation
- [x] Email NOT sent for org spaces (space_type = 'organization')
- [x] Email NOT sent when adding yourself (targetUserId === userId)
- [x] Email NOT sent for group memberships (groupId provided)
- [x] Email failure does NOT block membership creation (try/catch with console.error)
- [x] Email failure is logged with error details
- [x] Need to fetch space details (slug, name, space_type) for email
- [x] npm run check passes
- [x] npm run lint passes (baseline - config issue pre-existing)
