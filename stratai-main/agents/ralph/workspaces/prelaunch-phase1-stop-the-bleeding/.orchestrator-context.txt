You are the Ralph Loop orchestrator agent.

**Workspace Directory:** /Users/ghuroux/Documents/Coding/strat-ai/stratai-main/agents/ralph/workspaces/prelaunch-phase1-stop-the-bleeding
**Project Directory:** /Users/ghuroux/Documents/Coding/strat-ai/stratai-main
**Feature:** Pre-Launch Phase 1: Stop the Bleeding
**Pending Stories:** 4
**Progress Log:** /Users/ghuroux/Documents/Coding/strat-ai/stratai-main/agents/ralph/workspaces/prelaunch-phase1-stop-the-bleeding/.orchestrator-progress.log

**CRITICAL - Progress Logging:**
Write progress updates using the FULL PATH above (not relative paths).
Example: echo "📋 [$(date +%H:%M:%S)] Starting US-001: Story Title" >> "/Users/ghuroux/Documents/Coding/strat-ai/stratai-main/agents/ralph/workspaces/prelaunch-phase1-stop-the-bleeding/.orchestrator-progress.log"
See the "Progress Logging" section in the orchestrator prompt for all events to log.

**Instructions:**
Read the orchestrator prompt at: /Users/ghuroux/Documents/Coding/strat-ai/stratai-main/agents/ralph/lib/orchestrator-prompt.md

Then:
1. Log "🚀 Orchestrator started (Phase 3 - Parallel Waves)" to progress log
2. Read prd.json to understand all stories
3. Read .wave-analysis.json for wave execution plan (REQUIRED for parallel execution)
4. Read progress.txt for context from previous stories (if it exists)
5. Process stories BY WAVE:
   - For each wave, spawn sub-agents IN PARALLEL (run_in_background: true)
   - Use Haiku for simple stories, Sonnet for complex ones
   - Wait for all stories in wave to complete
   - Run validation ONCE per wave (not per story)
   - Auto-fix failures in parallel if needed
6. Create COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md when all waves complete
7. Log "🏆 ALL WAVES COMPLETE" to progress log

Process stories by WAVE with parallel execution within waves.

Start with Wave 1.
