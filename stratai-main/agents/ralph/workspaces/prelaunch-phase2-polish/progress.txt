# Ralph Progress Log

## Feature: Pre-Launch Phase 2: Polish the Experience
**Parent Task:** prelaunch-phase2-polish
**Started:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready to begin

## Codebase Patterns Discovered
- Empty state pattern: EmptyMemberState.svelte uses scoped CSS; spec recommends Tailwind (cleaner)
- Loading states: Stores have isLoading property already implemented
- Delete modals: DeleteConfirmModal.svelte exists for tasks; need new one for spaces
- Console logs: 265 occurrences across 23 files (lower than spec estimate)
- No skeleton components exist yet
- No debug utility exists yet
- Space delete has no cascade logic

## Stories
| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-001 | Create debug utility for environment-gated logging | pending |
| US-002 | Clean up console.log in high-density files | pending |
| US-003 | Create skeleton loading components | pending |
| US-004 | Integrate skeleton loaders into list views | pending |
| US-005 | Create reusable EmptyState component | pending |
| US-006 | Add empty states to spaces and areas views | pending |
| US-007 | Implement space deletion cascade in repository | pending |
| US-008 | Update space delete API and frontend to show cascade info | pending |

## Notes
- US-001 and US-003 and US-005 and US-007 can run in parallel (no dependencies)
- US-002 depends on US-001 (needs debug utility)
- US-004 depends on US-003 (needs skeleton components)
- US-006 depends on US-005 (needs EmptyState component)
- US-008 depends on US-007 (needs cascade logic)
