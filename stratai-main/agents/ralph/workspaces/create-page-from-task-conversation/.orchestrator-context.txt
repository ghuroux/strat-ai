**Workspace Directory:** /Users/ghuroux/Documents/coding/strathost-ai-main/stratai-main/agents/ralph/workspaces/create-page-from-task-conversation
**Project Directory:** /Users/ghuroux/Documents/coding/strathost-ai-main/stratai-main
**Feature:** unknown
**Pending Stories:** 2

**Instructions:**
Read the orchestrator prompt at: /Users/ghuroux/Documents/coding/strathost-ai-main/stratai-main/agents/ralph/lib/orchestrator-prompt.md

Then:
1. Read prd.json to understand all stories
2. Read .wave-analysis.json for parallelization insights (informational only)
3. Read progress.txt for context from previous stories (if it exists)
4. Implement each pending story by spawning Task sub-agents
5. Validate, auto-fix, update progress after each story
6. Create COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md when all stories complete

Work through stories sequentially. Do not parallelize (Phase 3).

Start with the first pending story.
