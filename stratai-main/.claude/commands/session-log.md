# Update Session Log

Add a new session log entry to CLAUDE.md documenting what was accomplished in this coding session.

## Steps

1. Read the current CLAUDE.md file
2. Find the "## Session Log" section
3. Create a new session entry at the TOP of the Session Log section (after the "## Session Log" header)
4. Include:

   - Focus area (brief description of session goal)
   - **Completed** items (numbered list)
   - **Files Created** (if any)
   - **Files Modified** (if any)
   - **Current State** (brief summary)
   - **Next session suggestions** (optional, 2-3 bullet points)
