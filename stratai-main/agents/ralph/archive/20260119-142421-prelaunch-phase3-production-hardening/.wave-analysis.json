US-004 (request deduplication) modifies modals and stores. These stories touch completely different files with one exception: ChatInput.svelte appears in both US-003 and US-004. However, US-003 adds iOS safe area padding to ChatInput while US-004 adds loading/disabled state to send button - these are orthogonal changes to different aspects of the component with minimal merge conflict risk. The modal modifications in US-003 (responsive styling) and US-004 (loading states) are also orthogonal. Given that US-002 touches different files entirely (page routes, not shared components) and the overlap between US-003 and US-004 involves different concerns (styling vs state management), parallelization is feasible with careful merge conflict resolution.",
